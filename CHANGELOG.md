Workarea Wish Lists 3.0.2 (2019-04-30)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Move utility nav link partial to a better location

    The `_wish_lists_link.html.haml` partial was stored in
    `app/views/layouts` which causes it to not be skipped or overridden in
    the expected way. This commit duplicates the file into
    `app/views/workarea/storefront/wish_lists` to avoid developer confusion
    and to allow it to be skipped by normal means.

    The previous file remains in place in order to not cause issues for
    applications that include this plugin, but will now fire off a
    deprecation warning, prompting developers to update the path themselves
    in their app.

Workarea Wish Lists 3.0.1 (2019-04-16)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Search Un-named Wish Lists by Email

    Since `Workarea::User#name` is now set to the email if a first/last name
    do not exist, update the wish list's name to always match that of the
    user. This allows searching wish lists by email when the user does not
    have a name associated with their account.

*   Assert Lack of "No Results" Text In Storefront System Tests

    Add specific assertions to ensure the correct results are appearing when
    users search for wish lists by email or full name. This ensures that the
    test will catch when wish list searches don't come up with any results.

*   Improve Reliability of "Add to Wish List" Button

    To make this button a bit less error-prone when wish-lists is combined
    with other plugins, use JS to perform the "Add to Wish List" request
    rather than relying on copying data from the PDP `<form>` into the
    `<form>` for adding a product to the wish list.

*   Return Item to Cart After Backing Out Of Moving to Wish List

    When a guest user attempts to move their item from cart to a wish list,
    Workarea presents them with a login page. If the user does not choose to
    log in, they will lose the item that they had previously added to cart
    even though it's still stored in their session. If the cart page is
    accessed, and there's a wish list item still stored in the session, the
    wish list item will be "dumped" back into the cart instead of being
    moved to the wish list.

Workarea Wish Lists 2.1.1 (2018-08-21)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Retain Customizations When Adding to Wish List

    When adding a product to a wish list, customizations for that product
    were not being retained and copied into the wish list (or added
    directly). Update the `storefront/users/wish_lists#add_item` action to
    copy in customizations from the order item, and not error out when
    adding a product to wish list, or moving a product from cart to wish
    list. Additionally, while testing this issue, it was discovered that
    customizations are not considered when searching for a wish list item
    that already exists (so its quantity can be updated). The
    `WishList#add_item` instance method will now factor in the passed-in
    customizations, and unless they differ, update the quantity for the
    existing item. If customizations do differ, the item is treated as
    unique and appears as an additional line item on orders/wish lists.

Workarea Wish Lists 2.1.0 (2018-05-24)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Delegate purchasability of wish list item to product, setup for minor

    As of workarea v3.3.0, Storefront::ProductViewModel#purchasable? also
    checks inventory. This makes the method for wish list items unnecessary
    and so the method is simply delegated to the product. Test was updated
    to reflect this behavior

*   Romove varians n+1 queries when viewing a wishlist

    OrderItemViewModel was causing redundant queries to pricing and
    inventory.  Pass the inventory sku and collection to reduce product view
    model from making extra queries.  Don't extend OrderItemInventory at
    runtime since wish list item view model isn't pulling double duty like
    order item view model.

*   Add customizations to wish list for logged out users.

    If a user is not logged in and they try to add an item to their wish list, we store the wish list item params in their session and then after they log in we redirect them to the wish list which triggers the item infor in the session to be added to their cart. However, the customizations for an item are not being copied to the wish list in this scenario. This commit adds the logic to store customizations in the session and add the customizations to the item.

This commit fixes the issue by storing the cart item in the session and then redirecting to the wish list after the user logs in.
